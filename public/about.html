<h1> About Me</h1>
<hr/>
<h4>
<p>This is my very first website that I made. Its very simple and nothing much to look at but, this is an exciting first project to me. I am just start learning how to do coding, html, css, Javascript, etc. whatever I need to learn to be a web developer.
  I am not a tech savvy so, for me to learn coding is very challenging at times but I am fiding the joy of coding.I believe learing new things or skills that we are not familar with is such an excitment. Not every step of the way is going to be easy or fun. But when you accomplish your tasks and educated yourself until the end is such a rewarding feeling.
 I can't wait until I finish all of the courses so I can get out there in the real world as 'Anna the web develper!'</p>
